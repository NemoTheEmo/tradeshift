# tradeshift triangle calculator

(quick note: the indentation looks very weird here in github, but is normal (4 spaces = 1 tab) locally in Sublime. Please overlook it)

This project is setup from an old angularJS seed project. Normally I would have made this using Angular 6 and Typescript, but since I just bought a new computer, which doesn't have any development-related things set-up yet, I decided on going with angularJS, as I don't have time to mess around trying to find an IDE with correct syntax highlighting etc. for ES6 and TS.

The app exposes one simple component called calculator, which has a partial with 3 number inputs and a submit button. The pressing the button passes the 3 provided values to a "calculateTriangleType" function which binds a string displaying which type of triangle the user provided.

I have tried to keep the app as simple as possible, but didn't have time to actually add tests, Though comments have been left in the code describing how it would be tested.

The package.json includes a lot of packages and dependencies that I didn't bother to sit down and sort out in. A lot of them are outdated since it's based on an old seed.

Thanks for taking your time to look at my code.

Nemo.
